use frame_support::traits::OnRuntimeUpgrade;

// Note to "late-migration":
//
// All the migrations defined in this file are so called "late-migration". We should have done the
// pallet migrations as soon as we perform the runtime upgrade. However the runtime v1090 was done
// without applying the necessary migrations. Without the migrations, affected pallets can no
// longer access the state db properly.
//
// So here we need to redo the migrations afterward. An immediate problem is that, after the new
// pallets are upgraded, they may have already written some data under the new pallet storage
// prefixes. Most of the pre_upgrade logic checks there's no data under the new pallets as a safe
// guard. However for "late-migrations" this is not the case.
//
// The final decision is to just skip the pre_upgrade checks. We have carefully checked all the
// pre_upgrade checks and confirmed that only the prefix checks are skipped. All the other checks
// are still performed in an offline try-runtime test.

// Add migrations here
