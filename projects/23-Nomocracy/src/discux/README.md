# Discux

Discux is a forum platform for users with the features of open-data and ownership.

Technically, it is just a service entry for the GUTP backend.

It consists of a set of simple/tidy web user interface, the reversed proxy to GUTP, and some aggregation processing work.

In the future, it will support the frontend from other entries, e.g: discord, telegram ..
