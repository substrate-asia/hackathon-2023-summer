# Project Description:
## Revolutionize the way AI monetize through NFTs

![Lisences](https://img.shields.io/github/license/danieltyx/ModelMint)

### Overview
We streamline the process of training customized AI models, distribution of the AI models, and IP, royalties management of created AI models with our NFT solution. Our marketplace allows everyone to monetize their AI models to anyone in the world through the power of NFTs.

### Problem
There are no effective ways to track the IP, royalties of AI model usage
Impossible to find the right model that solves users needs
Creators were rarely compensated for their model usage

### Product Features
- Pioneering no-code AI ✨ \
Train your customized AI model with no code directly on our platform
- Empowering AI Creators 💪\
Mint, Trade, and Profit from AI Models as NFTs - all in a few clicks
- AI Royalties Made Simple 💰\
Track and monetize your AI Model's IP and usage with our NFT solution, and use crypto to gain instant access to any AI models and interact with them directly on our platform

### Model NFT creation
The NFT contracts on the polkadot parachain can be deployed through the link here: https://kodadot.xyz/ksm/create?tab=Collection
