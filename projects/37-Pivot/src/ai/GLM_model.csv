0," Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then, in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being ""none of her business."" Only once had she put the doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on ""by another train."" Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks. ""You must be Miss Hope, the governess I?¡¥ve come to meet,"" said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument.
""Very well, if I must I must,"" said Lady Carlotta to herself with dangerous meekness.
""I am Mrs. Quabarl,"" continued the lady; ""and where, pray, is your luggage?""
""It?¡¥s gone astray,"" said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. ""I?¡¥ve just telegraphed about it,"" she added, with a nearer approach to truth.
""How provoking,"" said Mrs. Quabarl; ""these railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night,"" and she led the way to her car.
During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century.
""I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,"" said Mrs. Quabarl, ""but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week.""
""I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""
""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""
""That will not embarrass me in the least,"" said Lady Carlotta coldly.
Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

""How provoking,"" said Mrs. Quabarl; ""these railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night,"" and she led the way to her car.
During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century.
""I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,"" said Mrs. Quabarl, ""but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week.""
""I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""
""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""
""That will not embarrass me in the least,"" said Lady Carlotta coldly.
Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

Then, in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being ""none of her business."" Only once had she put the doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her.

She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on ""by another train.""

        At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their Line parents. ""They jumped up like popcorn,"" he said, describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly. 
Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds?¡¥ first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher was incredulous. ""He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, ??What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!?¡¥ "" At first it seemed unnatural?aground birds don?¡¥t like the ground? But as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he?¡¥d watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.
Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. ""I asked him how it went,"" Ken recalled, ""and he said,
 ??Terrible! The birds are cheating!?¡¥ "" Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the ""aha"" moment. ""The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively,"" he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
Working together with Terry (who has since gone on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. ""It?¡¥s like the spoiler on the back of a race car,"" he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.
Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.
In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don?¡¥t do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis).

30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.
Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. ""I asked him how it went,"" Ken recalled, ""and he said,
 ??Terrible! The birds are cheating!?¡¥ "" Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs.

""The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively,"" he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
Working together with Terry (who has since gone on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. ""It?¡¥s like the spoiler on the back of a race car,"" he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.
Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.
In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don?¡¥t do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis).

And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she knows why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....

This option is based on the idea that the percentage increase in the value of the account each year is directly proportional to the amount of money that is added to the account each year. This means that if the initial saving is $100 and the percentage increase in the value of the account each year is 2%, then the amount of money in the account will increase by 2% each year as well.",B,B,1,6500000000,1.10E+12,,,,,,,,

sum = a + b

So, we first add the values of the two other numbers to get their sum:

a + b = 855

Next, we add 50% to the sum to find x:

(a + b) + 50% = a + (b + a) / 2

Next, we simplify the expression to get x:

(a + b) + 50% = a + (a + b) / 2 / 2 = (a + b + 2) / 4

Finally, we divide by 4 to get x:

(a + b + 2) / 4 = a + b + 1

So, the value of x is:

x = (855 + 2) / 4 = 155

Therefore, the value of x is 155.",C,D: 155,1,6500000000,1.10E+12,,,,,,,,

If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?","{'A': '16', 'B': '21', 'C': '23', 'D': '26'}","To solve this problem, we can use the following formula:

n1 + n2 + n3 / 3

where n1, n2, and n3 are the amounts of solution given to each student, and the result is n.

We first need to find the total amount of solution in the beaker:

n1 + n2 + n3 = nn

Next, we need to find the total number of students:

n = n1 + n2 + n3 / 3 = 26n = 26

Finally, we can use this to find the amount of solution each student needs to receive in order to receive 4milliliters:

n4 = 4n4 = 4

Therefore, the total amount of solution needed to be distributed to the students in the class is:

n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 26 + 4 + 4 + 21 = 47

Which of the following could be the value of k ?","{'A': '0', 'B': '4', 'C': '8', 'D': '16'}","To determine the value of `k`, we need to find the value of `(k, 32)`. From the point-point relation, we have:

```
(k, 32) = (2, k) + (k, 32)
```

Substituting the values of `(2, k)` and `(k, 32)`, we get:

```
k = 2 + k
```

So, we need to solve for `k` in terms of `k`. This can be done by substitution. From the first point, we have:

```
k = 2
```

Substituting this into the second point, we get:

```
(2, k) + (k, 32) = (k, 32)
```

Substituting the value of `k` from the first equation into this equation, we get:

```
k = 32 + 2
```

Substituting this back into the first equation, we get:

```
2 = 32 + 2
```

49,,A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by p percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent",B, what is the value of p ?","{'A': '12', 'B': '15', 'C': '20', 'D': '22'}",48,"To solve this problem, we need to use the following公式?
A = L * W

where A is the area of the rectangle, L is the length and W is the width.

After changing the width by p%, we get:

W = W * (1 - p)

We also know that the area of the rectangle before the alterations was A.

A = L * W = (1 + 10/100) * (W * (1 - p)) = (1 + 1/10) * (W * (1 - p))

To find out what p is, we need to solve for W, which we can do by using the first公式?
W = W * (1 - p)

W = (1 + 10/100) * (1 - p) / p

化简得：

W = (1 + 10/100) * (1 - 1/10) / p

计算得：

p = (1 - 1/10) / (1 + 10/100) = (1/100 + 9/1000) / 11

化简得：

p = (11 / 100) + (99 / 1000) / 11

由于 1 / 100 ?1 / 1000 是互质的，所以上述两个分数可以表示为同一个分数的和，即：

p = 11 / 100 + 99 / 1000 = 11 / 1000

因此，p 的值为 11 / 1000?
因此，p 的值为 11 / 1000，即 (11 / 1000) * (1 - 1/10) = (11 / 1000) * (1 - 1/10) * (1 - 9/100) = 11 / 1000 * (1 - 1/10) * (1 - 19/100) = 11 / 1000 * (1 - 19/100) * (1 - 1/10) = 11 / 1000 * (1 - 1/10) * (1 + 9/100) = 11 / 1000 * 19 / 100 = 19 / 1000?,D,1,6500000000,1099511627776
